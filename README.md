# SimpleCardCounter

Idea here is to create a relatively simple application to be used while playing Blackjack
Intended workflows allowed:
 - Home screen gives ability to start a session
 - Within session, options include:
    - End Session
    - Track cards
  
Display:
 - Within a session:
     - Tell the user the running count and true count (rounded to 2 decimals)
     - Prompter user to change bet sizing based on count
